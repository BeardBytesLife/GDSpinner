	1.	Non-Commercial Use Only: The Software may be used, modified, and

      notice is included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.
	3.	Restrictions on Sale or Resale of Software: The Software, or any modified

      to pay royalties. Failure to do so constitutes a violation of this license.
